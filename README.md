# Clifford Attractors in Julia

Because they are nice to look at. The implementation given should scale to high resolutions with many iterations. Rendering a billion iterations takes just over a minute on an ageing laptop.

## Make your own

Images here were made with Julia 1.0 using the Images, FileIO, Colors, FixedPointNumbers and Statistics libraries. All code is in `clifford_attractors.jl` with full explanations of variables you can play with.

## Samples

![image_1](image_1.jpg =500x) 
![image_2](image_2.jpg =500x)
![image_3](image_3.jpg =500x)
![image_4](image_4.jpg =500x)
![image_5](image_5.jpg =500x)
![image_6](image_6.jpg =500x)
